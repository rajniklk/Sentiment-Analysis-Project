# Text Classification Project

For this project we'll use the Cornell University Movie Review polarity dataset v2.0 obtained from http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/

In this project we'll try to develop a classification model as we did for the SMSSpamCollection dataset - that is, we'll try to predict the Positive/Negative labels based on text content alone. In an upcoming section we'll apply Sentiment Analysis to train models that have a deeper understanding of each review
