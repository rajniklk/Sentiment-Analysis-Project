## Sentiment Analysis Project

* A basic task in sentiment analysis is classifying the polarity of a given text at the document, sentence, or feature/aspect level — whether the expressed opinion in a document, a sentence or an entity feature/aspect is positive, negative, or neutral. Advanced, “beyond polarity” sentiment classification looks, for instance, at emotional states such as “angry”, “sad”, and “happy”.

## Code and Resources Used

* Python Version: 3.7
* Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn
* Dataset obtained from http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/

## Data Handling

* Read in a collection of documents 
* Transform text into numerical vector data using a pipeline
* Create a classifier
* Fit/train the classifier
* Test the classifier on new data
* Evaluate performance

## Conclusion

Based on text alone we correctly classified reviews as positive or negative 84.7% of the time.
