## Sentiment Analysis Project

In this project we'll try to develop a classification model we'll try to predict the Positive/Negative labels based on text content alone.

## Code and Resources Used

* Python Version: 3.7
* Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn
* Dataset obtained from http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/

## Data Handling

* Read in a collection of documents 
* Transform text into numerical vector data using a pipeline
* Create a classifier
* Fit/train the classifier
* Test the classifier on new data
* Evaluate performance

## Conclusion

Based on text alone we correctly classified reviews as positive or negative 84.7% of the time.
